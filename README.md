If you wish to run this app via a clone, make sure you download the dependencies and run `npm start` to run it (It's a lot easier to download the zip and run the executable, it does the same thing)

BooruSlideshowElectron

A electron app for Booru Slideshow visit [my fork](https://github.com/DontTalkToMeThx/BooruSlideshow) or [the original](https://github.com/Chirmaya/BooruSlideshow)

And a lot of this code is Chirmaya's still, I just ported it and kept it up to date

Electron Apps: I no longer host built versions of the app. Please clone this repo and build it using `npm run build-win64` to get the folder with the executable for windows 64. There are other build scripts as well, if you need them, however only windows 64 was tested
